ClickCounter is a simple React component that tracks the number of times a user clicks on a button. It provides a visual count of the number of clicks to the user and allows the user to reset the count to zero.

The ClickCounter component typically renders a button and a text element. The text element displays the current count of clicks, which initially starts at zero. When the user clicks on the button, the count is incremented by one and the new count is displayed to the user.

The component also provides a reset button that, when clicked, sets the count back to zero. This allows the user to start over and count clicks again from scratch.

ClickCounter can be useful in situations where you need to track user interactions with a specific button or feature in your application. It provides a simple way to keep count of the number of times a particular action is taken, which can help you gain insights into how users are interacting with your application and identify areas for  improvement.
